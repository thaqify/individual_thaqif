				<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p style="color: #fff" font >My name is Muhammad Thaqif Bin Yusri Azam. Born on the 22nd February 1999. I only have two siblings including me. My hobby is playing video games, outdoor sports, and shopping. I have been playing sports since i was 4 years old. Well about games, i dont just play games for fun, i do it for money as well. I went for a competition for a couple times already and also has won it a couple times as well. Also i have played for a few big teams in Malaysia in Esports. Playing for them and carrying our nationality flag to the international level has been such a honor for me.
