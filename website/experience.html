<p style="color: #fff" font >I started playing games on a professional level in 2016. It was my very first time to play for a big teams representing Malaysia for esports. I was 17 that time and it was a day after my final SPM paper, i signed with the Stadium Fighter, which is the team that representing Malaysia for CSGO. I started joining tournaments with them a month later. It was our very own tournament playing together after a whole month of training at the house bootcamp in Shah Alam. On the first tournament that we went, we won. We also managed to be the at the top tier team in Malaysia for more than 2 years. in 2019, i finally realized that i have to stepped down from the team because i have no commitment towards the training and bootcamps since im at Rembau continuing my studies. By the end of 2019, i've finally stepped down from being a professional gamer. Throughtout my whole 2 years almost 3 years playing for Stadium Fighter i've really gained much more experience and knowledge than before.</p>
